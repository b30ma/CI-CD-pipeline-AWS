# CI-CD-pipeline-AWS
Implementing a CI/CD pipeline automation for SRE involves using various tools and technologies to enable continuous integration and deployment. Here's an example of a CI/CD pipeline automation with a code file:

# CI/CD Pipeline Setup:
You can use popular tools like Jenkins, AWS CodePipeline, or GitLab CI/CD to configure your CI/CD pipeline. Below is an example using Jenkins

# Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
To automate infrastructure provisioning, you can use tools like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to define and manage your infrastructure as code. Here's an example using 
In this example, a simple AWS EC2 instance is provisioned using Terraform. The provider block specifies the AWS region, while the resource block defines the instance configuration. Variables are used to parameterize the access and secret keys, which can be securely stored and retrieved using a secret management tool.

# Configuration Management:
Use configuration management tools like Ansible or Chef to automate the configuration of your application and infrastructure. Here's an example using Ansible:
This Ansible playbook installs required packages and copies application configuration files to the target servers. Upon configuration changes, it triggers a restart of the application server.
